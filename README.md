**Postal** is a complete and fully featured mail server for use by websites & web servers. Think Sendgrid, Mailgun or Postmark but open source and ready for you to run on your own servers. Postal is developed by [Krystal](https://k.io) to serve its own mail processing requirements and we have since decided that it should be released as an open source project for the community.
