Hello there,
<!--Sender25 - Changed Postal to Sender25 in the email template-->
<%= @user.name %> (<%= @domain.owner.is_a?(Organization) ? @domain.owner.name : @domain.owner.organization.name %>) would like to start sending e-mail from <%= @domain.name %> using Sender25. We're writing to you to request your authorization to allow this domain to be used to send e-mail through their mail server.

If you agree, please provide the code below to <%= @user.first_name %> who will be able to enter it into our web interface to continue.

<%= @domain.verification_token %>

If you don't agree, just ignore this e-mail.

Thanks,

<%= Postal.smtp_from_name %>
<%= Postal.smtp_from_address %>
