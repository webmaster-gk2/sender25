We're writing to let you know that your <%= @server.name %> mail server is approaching its send limit. All mail servers have a limit of how much e-mail they are permitted to send in a rolling 60 minute window. At present you have sent <%= @server.send_volume %> messages and have a limit of <%= @server.send_limit %>.

Orgaization: <%= @server.organization.name %>
Server: <%= @server.name %>
Send Limit: <%= @server.send_limit %>
Current Volume: <%= @server.send_volume %>

When you reach your limit, any mail you send will be held in the system until it is manually unheld by you through the web interface or using the API.

You can view more information about this server at:
