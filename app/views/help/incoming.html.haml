  %h1.pageContent__title Receiving e-mail
  %h2.pageContent__intro.u-margin
    This system can handle your incoming e-mail by accepting it from other mail servers and
    sending it on to your own applications using HTTP or to forward it to other SMTP servers.

    %h2.pageContent__subTitle Forwarding e-mails
    %p.pageContent__text
      If you already have a incoming mail server for your domain, you may find the quickest
      way to get up and running is to simply forward e-mail from that server.
      You don't need to make any changes to your DNS to do this.
    %p.pageContent__text
      Just #{link_to "create an incoming route", [organization, @server, :routes], :class => "u-link"}
      for the address you want to receive messages for and then you'll be provided with
      an e-mail address that messages can be forward to. Any message that is received to
      this address will be treated as if it had been sent directly to the address on the route.
    %p.pageContent__text
      The address to forward mail to can be found by clicking on the route and copying the
      field marked Address from the form.

    %h2.pageContent__subTitle Setting your MX records
    %p.pageContent__text
      If you don't already have a mail server on your domain, you can simply set your
      MX records to point to this system. The MX records are shown
      below and you should add these both as priority 10 in your DNS configuration. Once
      these have been added successfully they will show with a green tick on your domain list.
    %dl.pageContent__definitions
      %dt MX Records
      %dd
        - for mx in Postal.config.dns.mx_records
          %p.pageContent__definitionCode= mx
